## Our model

[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCBR/.github/main/img/CCBR_circle_diagram.png" width=600>](https://bioinformatics.ccr.cancer.gov/ccbr/)


The CCR Collaborative Bioinformatics Resource (CCBR) operates as a crucial support system within the National Cancer Institute, particularly for researchers at the Center for Cancer Research (CCR). CCBR brings together a team of bioinformatics experts from various institutions, including the CCR Office of Science and Technology Resources (OSTR), Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research (FNLCR), and the Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology (CBIIT). This collaborative model allows CCBR to offer a wide array of bioinformatics services, ranging from data analysis and interpretation to software development and training.


CCBR's working model emphasizes accessibility and collaboration. Researchers at CCR can easily request bioinformatics support through a formal project submission process. This process is designed to streamline access to bioinformatics resources, ensuring that projects receive timely and appropriate expertise. The CCBR team offers personalized consultations, both in-person and virtual, to understand the specific needs of each research project, facilitating a tailored approach that enhances the quality and impact of scientific research within the cancer research community.

The CCBR comprises of the core team and the embedded team. These teams serve different, but similar roles within the CCBR's support structure. 

- The core team consists of bioinformatics experts who provide centralized support to researchers, offering services such as data analysis, software development, and training across a broad range of projects. They are available to assist any CCR researcher who submits a request for bioinformatics help.

- The embedded team members are bioinformaticians who are integrated within specific research groups or labs. Their role is to provide more focused, day-to-day bioinformatics support tailored to the specific needs of the research group they are embedded in. This allows for a deeper collaboration and a more nuanced understanding of the ongoing research projects within that group.

## Pipelines

CCBR offers end-to-end analysis pipelines for NGS data analysis.

> <b><ins>RHEL8 BIOWULF updates:</ins></b>
> 
> In late 2023, [BIOWULF](https://hpc.nih.gov) migrated to a new operating system, [RHEL8](https://hpc.nih.gov/docs/rhel8.html). This migration rendered the Legacy functionality of CCBRPipeliner un-usable. We have been (and will continue to) work dilegently  to bring `ccbrpipeliner` suite of pipelines back on-line for our Biowulf users. At the same time, we are also taking this opportunity to not only increase our repetoire of pipelines but also modernize and containerize our end-to-end analysis offerings. These changes will minimize, if not eliminate, the pipelines' dependencies on other Biowulf modules and make `ccbrpipeliner` "operating system and HPC" - agnostic, thereby making it shareable with collaborators, and runnable on other HPCs (like [FRCE](https://ncifrederick.cancer.gov/staff/frce/welcome)) and beyond.

<sup>* CLI = Command Line Interface </sup>
<sup>* GUI = Graphical User Interface </sup>

<sup> **1** RENEE=_Rna sEquencing aNalysis pipElinE_ starts with raw fastq files and ends with counts matrix. Downstream DEG support will be added at a later date. In the mean time you can use NIDAP or [iDEP](http://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/idep96/) for DEG analysis.</sup>

<sup> **2** XAVIER=_eXome Analysis and Variant explorER_ will be soon available on Biowulf.</sup>

<sup> **3** ASPEN=_Atac Seq PipEliNe_ has limited support for differential ATACSeq signal analysis. CCBR has other pipelines for footprinting analysis like TOBIAS. Please reach out for details.</sup>

<sup> **4** CHAMPAGNE=_CHromAtin iMmuno PrecipitAtion sequencinG aNalysis pipEline_. CCBR plans to completely revamp ChIPSeq and may not be available until Q4 of 2023.
